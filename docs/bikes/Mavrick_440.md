I purchased Hero Mavrick 440 in __April 2024__ in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.

It is a fun motorcycle to ride, there are a few issues here and there but overall a good first choice.

I have also written all the cost that have incurred so far.

## Mavrick 440 Horn Issue

For some reason, my horn would stop working once the bike was overheating. After showing it in the service center they gave reasons as they initially thought it might be because of a loose connection or water but later when I kept the bike running for 40min in the showroom and then showed it to them, finally, they replaced it with no charge as it was covered in warranty.

## Mavrick 440 Clutch Wire Broke

I was riding the bike and when I was on a flyover the wire broke all of a sudden and I did not know what to do. Luckily some people helped me to reach a mechanic shop and he replaced it.

Initially, I thought it might be because of how I drive but turns out a lot of people faced this issue, even in Harley x440.

## Mavrick 440 Second Service Cost (5000 KM / 6 Months)

Since I had hardly used my bike for 900Km they did not change the complete oil but a portion of it.

I also got the clutch wire replaced with the original one.

- Labor: ₹135.7
- Oil: ₹241.7

Total: ₹1525.27 - ₹100 (Good Life Coupon) = ₹1425.27


## Riding Experience

This bike performs best in 30-100 KM/HR speed.

At lower speeds, you might feel little jerks here and there.

I took max to 100 as I did not have the proper gear and it became a little risky beyond that, but the bike was easily able to reach that speed.

Make sure you are aware when the surface is slippery as the rear tire sometimes skids a little.

Seat I did not find that comfortable. I have the seat cover as well but still, I find myself sliding towards the tank a lot.

They have done a good job in exhaust sound, which I totally love. It sounds better in fact when you have a helmet on.

## What more to have?

Accessories are very difficult to find. Even the showroom does not have any idea when it will be available.

Better performance in lower gears and speed.

Overall quality can be much better. I am facing major issues in parts. I hope they fix it soon. Even in new bikes as well it should not have happened.
