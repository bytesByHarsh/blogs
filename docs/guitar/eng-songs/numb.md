# Numb

**Capo - 2nd Fret**

```
I'm (Em) tired of being what you (C) want me to be
(G) Feeling so faithless, lost (D) under the surface
(Em) Don't know what you're (C) expecting of me
Put (G) under the pressure of (D) walking in your (C) shoes (D)
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every (Em) step that I take is (G) another mistake to (C) you (D)
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

(Em) I've become so (C) numb, I can't feel you (G) there
Become so (D) tired, so much more (Em) aware
I'm becoming this, (C) all I want to (G) do
Is be more like (D) me and be less like (Em) you

Can't you see that you're (C) smothering me,
(G) Holding too tightly, (D) afraid to lose (Em) control
'Cause everything that you (C) thought I would be
Has (G) fallen apart (D) right in front of (C) you. (D)
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every (Em) step that I take is (G) another mistake to (C) you (D)
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every (Em) second I waste is more than (G) I can (D) take.

(Em) I've become so (C) numb, I can't feel you (G) there,
Become so (D) tired, so much more (Em) aware
I'm becoming (C) this, all I want to (G) do
Is be more like (D) me and be less like (Em) you

And I (D) know
I may (Em) end (G) up (Em) failing (D) (C) too.
But I (D) know
You were just (B) like me with someone disappointed in you

(Em) I've become so (C) numb, I can't feel you (G) there
Become so (D) tired, so much more (Em) aware
I'm becoming (C) this, all I want to (G) do
Is be more like (D) me and be less like (Em) you

(Em) I've become so (C) numb, I can't feel you (G) there
(I'm tired of being what you (D) want me to be)
(Em) I've become so (C) numb, I can't feel you (G) there
(I'm tired of being what you (D) want me to be)
