# Love Me Like You Do

**Capo - 1st Fret**

```
You’re the (G) light, you’re the night
You’re the (Bm) color of my blood
You’re the (Em) cure, you’re the pain
You’re the (Em) only thing I wanna (C) touch
Never (D) knew that it could mean so (Em) much,
So (Em) much
You’re the (G) fear, I don’t care
‘Cause I’ve (Bm) never been so high
Follow (Em) me to the dark
Let me (Em) take you past our (C) satellites
You can (D) see the world you brought to (Em) life,
To (Em) life

So (G) love me like you do, (Bm) l-l-love me like you do
(Em) Love me like you do, (C) l-l-love me like you do
(Am) Touch me like you do, (Em) t-t-touch me like you do (Dsus2)
What are you (D) waiting for?

Fading (G) in, fading out
On the (Bm) edge of paradise
Every (Em) inch of your skin
is a (Em) holy grail I’ve got to (C) find
Only (D) you can set my heart on (Em) fire,
On (Em) fire
Yeah, (G) I’ll let you set the (Bm) pace
‘Cause (Em) I’m not thinking (Em) straight
My (C) head spinning around (D) I can’t see clear no (Em) more
What are you (Em) waiting for?

So (G) love me like you do, (Bm) l-l-love me like you do
(Em) Love me like you do, (C) l-l-love me like you do
(Am) Touch me like you do, (Em) t-t-touch me like you do (Dsus2)
What are you (D) waiting for?

(G) Love me like you do, (Bm) l-l-love me like you do
(Em) Love me like you do, (C) l-l-love me like you do
(Am) Touch me like you do, (Em) t-t-touch me like you do (Dsus2)
What are you (D) waiting for?

(G) (Bm) (Em) (Em)

Yeah, (G) I’ll let you set the (Bm) pace
‘Cause (Em) I’m not thinking (Em) straight
My (C) head spinning around (D) I can’t see clear no (Em) more
What are you (Em) waiting for?

(G) Love me like you do, (Bm) l-l-love me like you do
(Em) Love me like you do, (C) l-l-love me like you do
(Am) Touch me like you do, (Em) t-t-touch me like you do (Dsus2)
What are you (D) waiting for?

(G) Love me like you do, (Bm) l-l-love me like you do
(Em) Love me like you do, (C) l-l-love me like you do
(Am) Touch me like you do, (Em) t-t-touch me like you do (Dsus2)
What are you (D) waiting for?
