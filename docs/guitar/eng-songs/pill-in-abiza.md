# Pill in Abiza

**Capo - 3rd Fret**

**strumming pattern - DD UDUD DUDU**

```
[Verse 1]
I took a pill in(G) Ibiza
To show (D) Avicii I was cool
And when I (C) finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But (G) fuck it, it was something to do
(G) I'm living out in LA
I drive a (D) sports car just to prove
I'm a (C) real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I (G) spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be (Em) high like me
Never really knowing (D) why like me
You don't ever wanna (C) step off that roller coaster all (G) alone
You don't wanna ride the (Em) bus like this
Never knowing who to (D) trust like this
You don't wanna be (C) stuck up on that stage singing

(C) Stuck up on that stage singing

(Em) All I (D)know are sad (C) songs, sad (G) songs

(Em) All I (D)know are sad (C) songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a (G) singer who (D) already blew his shot
I get (C) along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a (G) pop song people forgot
(G) And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as (D) soon as the sun comes up
I (C) cut"em all loose and work's my excuse
But the (G) truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]

But you don't wanna be (Em) high like me
Never really knowing (D) why like me
You don't ever wanna (C) step off that roller coaster all (G) alone
You don't wanna ride the (Em) bus like this
Never knowing who to (D) trust like this
You don't wanna be (C) stuck up on that stage singing

(C) Stuck up on that stage singing

(Em) All I (D)know are sad (C) songs, sad (G) songs

(Em) Darlin, All I (D)know are sad (C) songs

[Verse 3]
I took a (G) plane to my home town
I brought my (D)pride and my guitar
All my (C) friends are all gone there's manicured lawns
And the (G) people still think I'm a star
(G) I walked around downtown
I met some (D) Fans on Lafayette
They said (C) tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I (G) looked 'em in the eye and said

[Chorus]

But you don't wanna be (Em) high like me
Never really knowing (D) why like me
You don't ever wanna (C) step off that roller coaster all (G) alone
You don't wanna ride the (Em) bus like this
Never knowing who to (D) trust like this
You don't wanna be (C) stuck up on that stage singing

(C) Stuck up on that stage singing

(Em) All I (D)know are sad (C) songs, sad (G) songs

(Em) Darlin, All I (D)know are sad (C) songs....
