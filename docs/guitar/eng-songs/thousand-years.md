# A Thousand Years

**Capo - 3rd Fret**

```
(C) Heartbeats fast
Colors and (G) promises
How to be (Em) brave
How can I (D) love when (G) I'm (C) afraid to fall
But watching you (G) stand alone
All of my (Em) doubt suddenly (D) goes (G) away (C) somehow
One step (Em) closer (D)

(G) I have died everyday waiting for you
(Em) Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a (C) thousand years
I love you for a (D) thousand more (G)

(C) Time stands still
Beauty in (G) all she is
I will be (Em) brave
I will not (D) let (G) anything (C) take away
What's standing in (G) front of me
Every (Em) breath
Every (D) hour has (G) come to (C) this
One step (Em) closer (D)

(G) I have died everyday waiting for you
(Em) Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a (C) thousand years
I love you for a (D) thousand more

(G) And all along I believed I would find you
(Em) Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a (C) thousand years
I love you for a (D) thousand more

(G) (Em) (C) (D)

(Am) One step (Em) closer (D) (Am)
One step (Em) closer (D)

(G) I have died everyday waiting for you
(Em) Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a (C) thousand years
I love you for a (D) thousand more

(G) And all along I believed I would find you
(Em) Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a (C) thousand years
I love you for a (D) thousand more

(C) (Em) (C) (Em) (D) (C)
