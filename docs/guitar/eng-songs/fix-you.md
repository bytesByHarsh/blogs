# Fix you

**Capo - 3rd Fret**

```
When you (C) try your best, but you (Em) don't succeed (Am) (G)
When you (C) get what you want, but (Em) not what you need (Am) (G)
When you (C) feel so tired, but you (Em) can't sleep (Am) (G)
Stuck in (C) reverse (Em) (Am) (G)

And the (C) tears come streaming (Em) down your face (Am) (G)
When you (C) lose something you (Em) can't replace (Am) (G)
When you (C) love someone, but it (Em) goes to waste (Am) (G)
Could it be (C) worse (Em) (Am) (G)

(F) Lights will (G) guide you (F) home
And (G) ignite your (F) bones
And I will (G) try to fix you

(C) (Em) (Am) (G)
(C) (Em) (Am) (G)

And (C) high up above or (Em) down below (Am) (G)
When you're (C) too in love to (Em) let it go (Am) (G)
But if you (C) never try you'll (Em) never know (Am) (G)
Just what you're (C) worth (Em) (Am) (G)

(F) Lights will (G) guide you (F) home
And (G) ignite your (F) bones
And I will (G) try to fix you

(C) (F) (C) (G) (Am) (F) (C) (G)
(C) (F) (C) (G) (Am) (F) (C) (G)

(C) Tears stream (F) down your face
(C) When you lose something (G) you cannot replace
(Am) Tears stream (F) down your face and (C) I (G)
(C) Tears stream (F) down your face
(C) I promise you I will (G) learn from my mistakes
(Am) Tears stream (F) down your face and (C) I (G)

(F) Lights will (G) guide you (F) home
And (G) ignite your (F) bones
And I will (G) try to fix you
