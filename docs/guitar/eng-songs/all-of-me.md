# All Of Me

**Capo - 1st Fret**

```
(Em) What would I (C) do without your smiling (G) mouth
Drawing me (D) in, and you kicking me (Em) out
Got my (C) head spinning, (G) no kidding, I (D) can't pin you (Em) down
What's going (C) on in that beautiful (G) mind
I'm on your (D) magical mystery (Em) ride
And I'm (C) so dizzy, don't (G) know what hit me, but (D) I'll be (Am) alright

My (Am) head's (G) underwater
But I'm (D) breathing (Am) fine
(Am) You're crazy and (G) I'm out of my (D) mind

Cause (G) all of me
Loves (Em) all of you
Love your (C) curves and all your edges
All your (D) perfect imperfections
Give your (G) all to me
I'll give my (Em) all to you
You're my (C) end and my beginning
Even (D) when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you (Em) all (C) of (G) me (D)
And you give me (Em) all (C) of (G) you, (D) oh

(Em) How many (C) times do I have to tell (G) you
Even when you're (D) crying you're beautiful (Em) too
The world is (C) beating you (G) down, I'm (D) around through every (Em) mood
You're my (C) downfall, you're my (G) muse
My worst (D) distraction, my rhythm and (Em) blues
I can't stop (C) singing, it's (G) ringing, in my (D) head for (Am) you

My (Am) head's (G) underwater
But (D) I'm breathing (Am) fine
(Am) You're crazy and (G) I'm out of my (D) mind

Cause (G) all of me
Loves (Em) all of you
Love your (C) curves and all your edges
All your (D) perfect imperfections
Give your (G) all to me
I'll give my (Em) all to you
You're my (C) end and my beginning
Even (D) when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you (Em) all (C) of (G) me (D)
And you give me (Em) all (C) of (G) you, (D) oh

Give me all of (Am) you
(Am ) Cards on the (G) table, we're (D) both showing (Am) hearts
Risking it (G) all, though it's (D) hard

Cause (G) all of me
Loves (Em) all of you
Love your (C) curves and all your edges
All your (D) perfect imperfections
Give your (G) all to me
I'll give my (Em) all to you
You're my (C) end and my beginning
Even (Em) when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you (Em) all (C) of (G) me (D)
And you give me (Em) all (C) of (G) you, (D) oh
I give you (Em) all (C) of (G) me (D)
And you give me (Em) all (C), all of (G) you, (D) oh.
