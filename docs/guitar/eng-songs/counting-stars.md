# Counting Stars

**Capo - 4th Fret**

```
(Am) Lately I've been, (C) I've been losing sleep
(G) Dreaming about the things that (F) we could be
But, (Am) baby I've been, (C) I've been praying hard
(G) Said no more counting dollars, (F) we'll be counting stars
Yeah, (F) we'll be counting stars

I see this (Am) life like a swinging vine,
(C) Swing my heart across the line
(G) In my face is flashing signs,
(F) Seek it out and ye shall find.

(Am) Old but I'm not that old
(C) Young but I'm not that bold
(G) And I don't think the world is sold
(F) I'm just doing what we're told

(Am) I I I I (C) feel something so (G) right by doing the (F) wrong thing
(Am) And I I I I (C) feel something so (G) wrong by doing the (F) right thing

(F) I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
(F) Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

(Am) Lately I've been, (C) I've been losing sleep
(G) Dreaming about the things that (F) we could be
(Am) Baby I've been, (C) I've been praying hard
(G) Said no more counting dollars, (F) we'll be counting stars

(Am) Lately I've been, (C) I've been losing sleep
(G) Dreaming about the things that (F) we could be
(Am) Baby I've been, (C) I've been praying hard
(G) Said no more counting dollars, (F) we'll - we'll be counting stars

I feel the (Am) love
And I feel it burn (C) down this river every time
(G) Hope is our four-letter word, (F) make that money watch it burn

(Am) Old but, I'm not that old
(C) Young, but I'm not that bold
(G) And I don't think the world is sold
(F) I'm just doing what we're told

(Am) And I I I I (C) feel something so (G) wrong by doing the (F) right thing
I could (F) lie, couldn't I, couldn't I
(F) Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

(Am) Lately I've been, (C) I've been losing sleep
(G) Dreaming about the things that (F) we could be
(Am) Baby I've been, (C) I've been praying hard
(G) Said no more counting dollars, (F) we'll be counting stars

(Am) Lately I've been, (C) I've been losing sleep
(G) Dreaming about the things that (F) we could be
(Am) Baby I've been, (C) I've been praying hard
(G) Said no more counting dollars, (F) we'll be - we'll be counting stars

(Am) Oh, take that money (Am) watch it burn,
(Am) Sing in the river the (Am) lessons I learned
(Am) Oh, take that money (Am) watch it burn,
(Am) Sing in the river the (Am) lessons I learned
(Am) Oh, take that money (Am) watch it burn,
(Am) Sing in the river the (Am) lessons I learned
(Am) Oh, take that money (Am) watch it burn,
(Am) Sing in the river the (Am) lessons I learned
