# Treat You Better

**Capo - 1st Fret**

```
(Am) I won't (G) lie to you (F)
I know he's (Am) just not (G) right for you (F)
And you can (Am) tell me if I'm off
But I (G) see it on your face
When you (F) say that he's the one that you want
And you're (Am) spending all your time
In this (G) wrong situation
And (F) anytime you want it to stop

I know I can (Am) treat you (G) better
(F) Than he can (C)
And any girl like (Am) you (G) deserves a (F) gentleman (C)
Tell me why are we (Am) wasting time
On all your (G) wasted crying
When you should (F) be with me instead (C)
I know I can (C) treat you (G) better
(F) Better than he can

(Am) I'll stop (G) time for you (F)
The second you (Am) say you'd (G) like me (F) to
(Am) I just wanna give you the (G) loving that you're missing
(F) Baby, just to wake up with you

Would be (G) everything I need and this (G) could be so different
(Am) Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can (Am) treat you (G) better (F) than he can (C)
And any girl like (Am) you (G) deserves a (F) gentleman (C)
Tell me why are we (Am) wasting time
On all your (G) wasted crying
When you should (F) be with me instead (C)
I know I can (C) treat you (G) better
(F) Better than he can

(Am) (F) (C) Better than he can
(Am) (F) (C)

(Am) Give me a (G) sign
Take my (C) hand, we'll be (F) fine
(Am) Promise I (G) won't let you (F) down
Just (Am) know that you (G) don't
Have to (C) do this (F) alone
(Am) Promise I'll (G) never let you (F) down

'Cause I know I can (Am) treat you (G) better (F) than he can (C)
And any girl like (Am) you (G) deserves a (F) gentleman (C)
Tell me why are we (Am) wasting time
On all your (G) wasted crying
When you should (F) be with me instead (C)
I know I can (C) treat you (G) better
(F) Better than he can

(Am) (F) (C) Better than he can
(Am) (F) (C)
