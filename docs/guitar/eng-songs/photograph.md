# Photograph

```
Loving can (C) hurt
Loving can (Am) hurt sometimes
But it’s the (G) only thing that I know (F)
When it gets (C) hard
You know it can get (Am) hard sometimes
It is the (G) only thing that makes us feel alive (F)

(Am) We keep this love in a (F) photograph
(C) We make these memories (G) for ourselves
Where our (Am) eyes are never closing
Our (F) hearts were never broken
And (C) times forever frozen (G) still
So you can (C) keep me inside the pocket of your
(G) Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
(Am) Eyes meet, you won’t ever be (F) alone
Wait for me to come home (C)
Loving can (C) heal
Loving can (Am) mend your soul
And it’s the (G) only thing that I know (F)
I swear it will get (C) easier
Remember that with every (Am) piece of you
And it’s the (G) only thing that we take with us when we die (F)
(Am) We keep this love in a (F) photograph
(C) We make these memories (G) for ourselves
Where our (Am) eyes are never closing
Our (F) hearts were never broken
And (C) times forever frozen (G) still
So you can (C) keep me inside the pocket of your
(G) Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
(Am) Eyes meet, you won’t ever be (F) alone
And if you (C) hurt me well that’s ok baby, only
(G) Words bleed inside these pages you just
(Am) Hold me and I won’t ever let you (F) go

Wait for me to come (Am) home
Wait for me to come (F) home
Wait for me to come (C) home
Wait for me to come (G) home

Oh you can (C) fit me inside the necklace you got when you were
(G) sixteen next to your heartbeat where I
(Am) Should be, keep it deep within your (F) soul
And if you (C) hurt me that’s ok baby only
(G) words bleed inside these pages you just
(Am) Hold me and I won’t ever let (F) you go

When I’m (C) away I will remember how you
(G) Kissed me under the lamp post back (Am) on sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the (F) phone
Wait (G) for me to come home
