# Emptiness

**Capo - 4th Fret**

```
(G) A love of mine
With a(Em)song and a wine
You're(C)harsh and divine
Like truths(D)and a lie

But the(G)tale ends not here
I've(Em)nothing to fear
For my(C)love is hellof giving and(D)hollow

And the(G)bright emptiness
In a(Em)room full of it
Is a(C)cruel mistress
Woh(D)ho

I(G)feel this unrest
That nest(Em) of hollowness
For I(C)have nowhere to go and I'm (D)cold

Here I feel so(G)lonely (Em)yeah
(C)There's a better place than this, (D)emptiness
And I'm so(G)lonely (Em)yeah
(C)There's a better place than this, (D)emptiness, yeah

(G) (Em)(C)(D)
(G)(Em)(C)(D)

Tune mere(G)jaana, kabhi nahi(Em)jaana
(C)Ishq mera, dard(D)mera haye
(G)Tune mere jaana,(Em)kabhi nahi jaana
(C)Ishq mera, dard(D)mera

Aashiq(G)tera (Em)
(C)Bhid mein khoya(D)rehta hai
Jaane jaa (G)han (Em)
(C)Poocho to itna(D)kehta hai

That I feel so(G)lonely (Em)yeah
(C)There's a better place than this, (D)emptiness
And I'm so(G)lonely (Em)yeah
(C)There's a better place than this, (D)emptiness, yeah (G)
